### Abstract

The transpose is an order-2 operation on square matrices that
preserves addition and reverses multiplication. For complex square matrices,
the hermitian conjugate has the same properties. I will consider a sequence of
increasingly exotic analogues of these operations. These analogues are related
to the topological properties of certain spaces: both familiar and novel. I
will try to explain all this.

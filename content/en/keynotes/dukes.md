### Abstract

How might you capture the notion of "dimension" of a space without any
reference to coordinates or directions?  This talk will explore this idea
through the lens of finite geometries.

We'll define a *linear space* as a set of points \\( X \\) equipped with a family \\( \mathcal{L} \\) of subsets of \\( X \\) called lines.  A *subspace* is just what you'd expect, namely a linear space \\( (X^\prime, \mathcal{L}^\prime) \\) where \\( X^\prime \subseteq X \\) and \\( \mathcal{L}^\prime \subseteq \mathcal{L} \\).  The *dimension* of a linear space is the maximum integer \\( d \\) such that any set of \\( d \\) points is contained in a proper subspace.

We'll see several examples of finite linear spaces and examine their dimension. We'll also see an application of these ideas to a certain problem in extremal combinatorics.

This is based on joint work with Alan Ling and former student co-authors Nick Benson and Joanna Niezen.

### Abstract

An L-function \\( L(s,X) \\) is a meromorphic function on the complex plane
that is usually associated with an object \\( X \\) of arithmetic, algebraic or
geometric nature. A central theme in analytic number theory is to understand
the behavior of L-functions inside the critical strip \\( 0 < Re(s) < 1 \\). The
generalized LindelÃ¶f Hypothesis is a statement about the size of L-functions in
the critical strip, and it motivates the study of moments of L-functions as a
crucial tool for investigation. In fact, establishing asymptotic formulae for
moments of L-functions has become a focal point in analytic number since the
early 1900's. A major breakthrough in this area occurred in 1998 when Keating
and Snaith established a conjectural formula for moments of the Riemann zeta
function using ideas from random matrix theory. The methods of Keating and
Snaith led to similar conjectures for moments of many families of L-functions.
These conjectures have become a driving force in this field which has witnessed
substantial progress in the last two decades.

In this talk, I will review the history of this subject and survey some recent
results. If time permits, I will discuss recent joint work with Nathan Ng and
Fatma Cicek on the mean values of long Dirichlet polynomials which could be
used to model moments of the zeta function.

### Abstract

They say the only normal people are the ones you don't know very
well. What about numbers? Which ones are normal, and how well do we know
them?

The notion of mathematical normality is related to the occurrence of
different digits in a number. Roughly speaking, a normal number is one in
which every block of digits appears with the same limiting frequency. For
example, \\( 0.12345678910111213 \dots \\) is normal in base 10, but \\( 0.1212121212 \dots \\) is
not. Normality of numbers is connected to many areas of mathematics, like
diophantine approximation, ergodic theory, geometric measure theory,
analysis and computer science.

We will discuss a few open problems about normal numbers that lie at the
intersection of harmonic analysis and measure theory, and mention some
recent progress on them.

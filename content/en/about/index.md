CUMC is a week-long conference from the 8th to 12th of July, specifically aimed at undergraduates who are interested in mathematics, and is being run by UBC students this year, right here on campus! Throughout the week, you will get the chance to watch presentations prepared by other undergraduates on a topic of their interests (whether that be their own research or just on topics not typically covered in an undergraduate curriculum) as well as present your own if you would like. There will also be keynote speakers who are active mathematicians, as well as plenty of social events where you can meet young mathematicians from across the country. We have the following events:

- A barbeque social at one of Vancouver’s most beautiful beaches.
- Academically inclined events, such as coffee chats with graduate students, a Women and Diversity in math panel, and a math competition workshop.
- A banquet at [Seasons in the Park](https://www.vancouverdine.com/seasons/), which will have a terrific view of downtown Vancouver at night                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Registration also includes the majority of the meals throughout the week!

One’s perception of mathematics and what is interesting is heavily influenced by the environment where they learn it, hence this is a great opportunity to see all the things happening in the world of mathematics that you might not have seen in your time at UBC.

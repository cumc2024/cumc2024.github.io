### Abstract

Accurate, robust and fast image reconstruction is a critical task in many
scientific, industrial and medical applications. The quest for ever-better
image reconstruction algorithms involves a wealth of different mathematical
topics, from basic linear algebra to functional and harmonic analysis, PDEs,
high-dimensional probability, convex analysis and optimization, and most
recently, the mathematics of deep neural networks and deep learning. In this
talk I will introduce a range of different techniques for image reconstruction.
I will highlight the crucial and varied role that mathematics plays in this
field, and discuss both recent advances and future challenges and prospects.

### Abstract

Much clinical and experimental research has focussed on deciphering the
mechanisms by which patients with Type-2 Diabetes move from healthy through
pre-diabetic to fully diabetic. Some modeling work has been done to put these
theories to the test but it is surprisingly incomplete. In this talk, I will
give an overview of the ongoing work of PhD student Katie Faulkner, who is
working with me and Prof Jim Johnson (Dept of Cellular and Physiological
Sciences) on building a theoretical framework for understanding this process.
The model consists of a system of ODEs describing the way the body handles
glucose, fats, insulin and a few related quantities. The analysis is primarily
bifurcation theory. No biology background is required although some tolerance
for a bit of jargon may be useful.

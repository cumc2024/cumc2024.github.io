We understand that presenting a talk at the CUMC can seem daunting, especially if you have never given a presentation before or if you are new to math. But the CUMC is meant for you! Each year, many undergraduates give their very first talks at the CUMC, and discover new, beautiful mathematics through connections with peers they would not have otherwise met.

This year, UBC will be hosting a couple of events to help you decide whether you’d like to join us, and if you do, to help you prepare to give talks! If you’re interested in the CUMC but you’re nervous about signing up, these events are for you. We will have:

- June 17th: A panel of former CUMC presenters talking about their first time at the CUMC; This will give prospective attendees an idea of what to expect, and look forward to at the conference. We will also be going over this years events, and taking questions about the CUMC.
- June 19th: A workshop going over some old CUMC talks and some ideas for what makes a good presentation. This will be lead by Dr. Richard Anstee, from the University of British Columbia, and the organizers of this years conference. This session will include the do's and don't's  of a CUMC presentation, and some snippets from previous presentations.

These events will both take place over Zoom.  Registration is free, but required. [Here](https://forms.gle/WvV9WCDbCetzE3PP9) is a google form with the registration. Please fill this form out before June 16th, and upon completion, we will send the details of the Zoom meeting.

- [Cecil Green Park House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wfVq8NvpWn7vGP6GA): This is partially a graduate student residence, which is not accessible by the public. We request that you respect their privacy. There is also a chance that the main house is booked out for a private event, but if it’s not this is a very nice place to walk around in.

## Touching grass

- [Capilano Suspension Bridge Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JCBMBrKBJCN5Lubt5): Very pretty place, but it has a hefty entrance fee. It is also pretty far from UBC campus, so this is more of a weekend day trip.
- [Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6vaGtAFnXGSdLkq56): Another place to hike that has a suspension bridge, but it is completely free. This is also pretty far, and would be a weekend day trip.
- Whistler: This is a very popular hiking spot a few hours out from Vancouver by car. The village in Whistler is accessible via a shuttle that connects from Downtown. However, the village is not particularly well connected to some of the cooler hikes.
- Squamish: Another popular hiking spot, which is also a couple hour long drive from Vancouver.

Restaurants on university boulevard.

- [Ramen Danbo Kitsilano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QKDAqSPKnQz2gt1U7): Very popular ramen spot. This is generally VERY busy, so we suggest avoiding peak hours, and monitoring Yelp - so you can put yourself on the waitlist. They also have a downtown location, but this is even busier.

- [Big Way Hot Pot 大味 (Kerrisdale)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QMqEbBDkyTjGUxJz5)
- [Aberdeen Center Food Court](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aXg7SbCE3m9WSegy8)/[Richmond Public Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mypkUZXYtMpxtMtu6): We suggest carrying cash if you plan to visit these places.
- If you are interested, you can check out some of the [Michelin star restaurants](https://guide.michelin.com/ca/en/british-columbia/ca-vancouver/restaurants?sort=distance) of Vancouver.
- Vegan/vegetarian friendly places (these have multiple locations)
  - [Vegan Shoku Japanese Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tkyv2W726CPh1VcN7)

## Transportation

### Overarching Principles

Vancouver’s transit system is handled entirely through a card system, called Compass. At entrances to buses, and both entrances/exits for trains, you need to tap your card to get on (and off). This can either be a Compass card (which you can purchase at vending machines in train stations or at Shoppers / London Drugs) or a credit card. With a card, you are able to transfer in a 90 minute window without paying another fee (ask for a transfer ticket if you intend to pay by cash). It is cheaper per ride to pre-load money on the Compass card, but the card costs $6 (it is technically refundable if you return your card at the end of your trip… but this is to select, inconvenient locations and no one really does it; if you want to figure this out, you should call Vancouver Translink because information online is sparse). For specific pricing, see [here](https://www.translink.ca/transit-fares/pricing-and-fare-zones).

We’ll list the specific buses to get to our event locations below, but for general transportation, UBC has a bus exchange (and a bus loop, which have distinct buses) that should be able to take you to most locations. To return to UBC, almost anywhere you should find a bus returning to UBC, i.e.

{{< center >}} “All roads lead to UBC.” {{< /center >}}

There are certain “express” buses which should take you to most destinations faster, and come more often: 99, R4, 44. NOTE: transit in Vancouver ends surprisingly early. Most buses and trains end their service from 12:00AM - 1:00AM. There are limited night buses (the only one that goes through UBC is the N17, which connects UBC to Downtown), but even these end their service at about 3:00 - 4:00AM.
To and From the Airport
Taxi/Uber is about $35-40 to UBC Vancouver campus. It is, however, cheaper than this often.
Compass cards can be bought from the Skytrain station at YVR airport; these machines are also used to load money onto the compass cards.
The most convenient transit route to UBC campus from the airport is to take the Skytrain to Oakridge-41st Avenue station, and take the “R4 41st Avenue to UBC” till the end of the line.
Ubers are usually cheaper going to the airport from UBC.
The most convenient transit route to the airport is taking the “R4 41st Avenue to Joyce station” to Oakridge-41st Avenue station, and taking the Skytrain to YVR airport.
Off-Campus Events

## Beach BBQ Social

This is the opening social of the conference. We will be running BBQ’s at [Locarno beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/11vsHYUiJkVWFR5Z6) (Google Maps), with hot dogs and burgers! This starts at 6:00pm and will run until 9:00pm. To reach the beach, you can walk, or you can take the 084 bus or 004. Bussing will take about 10 minutes, and walking 15.

## Banquet

This will be a banquet that requires a ticket (purchased alongside registration) and will be held off UBC campus at [Seasons in the Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M7X9pefB1Lou6hiN7) (Google Maps). To reach the event, one can catch the R4 Bus from UBC, and take it all the way to Queen Elizabeth park, where the restaurant is located (you will have to walk through the park to get to the restaurant, it is at the top of the hill).To arrive on time, if you are taking the bus, we recommend leaving at 6:00 from UBC, and 6:30 if driving. Dinner begins at 7:00, so please arrive by then. The dress code is semi-formal.
